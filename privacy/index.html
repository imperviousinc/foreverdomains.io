          <p>We respect the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you access or use the Website or any of our other products or services (the Website and any of our other products or services, collectively, referred to as the “<strong>Services</strong>”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.</p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect (i) on or through your use of the Services; (ii) in email and other electronic messages between you and Impervious; and (iii) through any mobile and desktop applications you use in connection with the Services.</p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information you provide to or is collected by any third party whether through or in connection with your use of the Services or otherwise, including through any third-party application or content that may link to or be accessible from or on the Services. You agree and acknowledge that Impervious has no duty or responsibility to maintain and safeguard any information you may provide to, or is collected by, any third party whether through or in connection with your use of the Services or otherwise.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into our Terms of Service, found at <a href="https://foreverdomains.io/terms/index.html">https://foreverdomains.io/terms/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.

<p>This privacy policy may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy Policy below). Your continued use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this privacy policy periodically for updates.</p>

<p>We may collect this information (i) directly from you when you provide it to us, (ii) automatically as you use the Services (which information may include usage details, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and information collected through cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies), and (iii) from third parties (such as our business partners).</p>

<p>The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><strong>Cookies and other similar technologies</strong>. We may place cookies on your device to collect anonymous data related to your use of the Services.

We may use cookies to provide certain features of the Services. It may be possible to refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your device. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain features of the Services. We may also use other technologies to tailor the Services to you, such as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit Impervious, for example, to track how visitors interact with the Services and for other statistics related to the Services (such as recording the popularity of certain content and verifying system and server integrity).</li>
<li><strong>Log Information</strong>.

<li><strong>Location-Based Data</strong>. We may collect and process information about your geographic location (for example, through GPS signals) when you use the Services. We will not store or track your device location on an on-going basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geolocation data with third parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics Data</strong>. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services.
